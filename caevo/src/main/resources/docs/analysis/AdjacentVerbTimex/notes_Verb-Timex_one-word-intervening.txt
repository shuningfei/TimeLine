the important thing is that 1971 not a temporal argument of overruled.
we could get this from SRL.

consider "he will start a six year contract with ..."

what we really want to do is find the event time of overruled and then relate that to 1975 (obviously, this is the promise of transitivity)
if a intervenes and the timex is a date, then draw an inference based on tense/aspect reference time, dct, timex value...

verb "a" timex

likelty that timex modifies some other thing.


sieve about timex modifying things?


verb "in" timex - no brainer? what about "die in three weeks" -> this sort of means after three weeks.

verb "on" timex is probably the most straightforward, but also default is ii so we don't even need to consider it (right?)
