It certainly wasn't as easy as the Belgians had anticipated but two second half goals from substitutes were the difference as Marc Wilmots' club downed Algeria 2-1 on Tuesday.

The first half couldn't have gone any better for the Algerians, who, while defending for the majority of the half, took advantage with a quick counter that led to a penalty kick. Sofiane Feghouli buried the first goal, but for the rest of the half, the Algerians were on their heels trying to stave off the Belgian attack.
