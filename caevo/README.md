CAEVO: Cascading EVent Ordering System

A TempEval-style system for extracting temporal entities (events and time 
expressions), and labeling the temporal relations between the temporal entities.

Prerequisites
-------------

CAEVO uses the WordNet dictionaries. The dictionary files can be
downloaded from:

    http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/wn3.1.dict.tar.gz

You also need a jwnl_file_properties.xml file that points to the location of
your downloaded dictionary. The dictionary and this file can be stored anywhere
on your drive. CAEVO looks for an environment variable JWNL that should have the
path to the xml file.

For convenience, you can also download and install the directories with the
provided shell script (there is a sample jwnl_file_properties.xml file in 
src/test/resources):

    ./download-wordnet-dictionaries


Building
--------

    mvn compile
    mvn test
    mvn install
